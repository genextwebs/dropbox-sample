How it will work?

1. Run index.php & it will download 2 csvs from your dropbox account. I have preauthorized your account using dropbox login & used access token for accessing data.


2. These 2 files will be downloaded in downloads folder. 

3. Now I am reading these csv files using PHP & generating new csv file with the name merged_file.csv & it will be downloaded automatically.

That's it!

Thank you!
